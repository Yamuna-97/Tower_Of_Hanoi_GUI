# Tower of Hanoi GUI 🏰

A graphical version of the **Tower of Hanoi puzzle**, implemented in **C** with a simple GUI.

---

## 📌 About
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks. The goal is to move all disks from the first rod to the last rod, following the rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. All disks must eventually be moved to the target rod.

This project provides a **C implementation with a graphical interface**.
